# Be Reactive
### about reactive software

This repo contains Java (Kotlin!) code to demonstrate:
* key features of reactive programming
* async programming with Futures and CompletableFutures
* Rx Observables ([RxJava](http://reactivex.io/))

[Here](https://slides.com/robbosman/be-reactive#/) is my presentation that goes along with the code.

### development environment
This is what I did to set-up the development environment:
* install [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) version 8 or higher
* install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Community edition is fine)
* enable [Kotlin plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/kotlin.html) in IntelliJ IDEA
* install [MongoDB Comminuty server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) (Atlas Cloud Database works too)
* install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) (not required, but comes in handy)
